                        Stan asked if I wanted to play but I said I wasn't good at it. Really I just didn't want him to know I've never had my own controller.
                        
                        His mom made us sandwiches and gave me two to take home "for later." She's really nice like that.

                        He was surprised I came. Said "Kenny, you're the only one who cares when I'm dying." Then he ate the whole bowl and said it was good.

                        Her project was about butterflies and she made the most beautiful drawings. The librarian said it was "very creative and thoughtful."

                        I ended up selling 20 candy bars total! Not the most in class, but enough that I didn't feel left out during the pizza party.

                            *Translation: Had a weird thought today! All the grown-ups are always worried about money and bills and stuff. But I still get excited when I find a shiny Pokemon card in the street!*

                        Like, I know we're poor and that's hard. But I also know that finding a Charizard card can make my whole week awesome.
                        
                        Maybe that's the trick - you can understand grown-up problems but still let kid stuff make you happy.
                        
                        Karen found a really pretty feather yesterday and carried it around all day like it was treasure. She's got the right idea.

                        Then at lunch I sat down at our table and nobody said hi. Not mean or anything, just... like I wasn't there.
                        
                        But then Clyde dropped his lunch money and I helped him find it under the table. He said "Thanks Kenny!" really loud and smiled.
                        
                        Maybe I'm not invisible. Maybe I'm just quiet. There's a difference, I think.

                        I know it might not last long. Dad's been talking about "big plans" again and that usually means he'll mess something up.
                        
                        But right now Karen is watching SpongeBob and laughing really loud. And right now we have hot water for showers.
                        
                        Sometimes right now is enough. You can't live in tomorrow's problems when today has lights and cartoons.
