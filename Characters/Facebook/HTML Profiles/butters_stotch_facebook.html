                        Oh hamburgers, what a wonderful day! 😄
                        
                        Today Eric asked me to be his "business partner" in selling "premium air" to classmates! I feel so special that he chose ME to help with his important work!
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            I spent all morning blowing into bottles for him. My cheeks hurt something fierce, but Eric says that means I'm doing a really good job! He's letting me keep 2% of the profits because I'm such a valuable employee!
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="optimistic-spin">
                            Sure, some kids are calling it a "scam," but I think they're just jealous they didn't think of it first! Eric is so creative and business-minded. I'm learning so much about entrepreneurship!
                        </div>
                        
                        Kyle seemed upset about something and started yelling, but Eric explained that Kyle just doesn't understand innovation. I sure am lucky to have such a smart friend who includes me in his projects!
                        
                        <div class="grounding-alert">
                            UPDATE: Mom found the empty bottles in my room and now I'm grounded for "participating in fraudulent business practices." I don't know what that means, but it must be something bad! Oh well, more time to think about all the fun I had helping Eric!

                        Today I enacted my most diabolical scheme yet: I switched the salt and sugar in the cafeteria! Soon, everyone's cookies will taste like... well, cookies with salt instead of sugar!
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            Actually, I felt really bad when I saw Jenny make a face after biting her cookie, so I went and told the lunch lady what I did. She just laughed and said it was "sweet" that I was honest. I don't think she gets how evil I'm supposed to be!
                        </div>
                        
                        Being a supervillain is harder than it looks! Every time I try to do something bad, I end up feeling guilty and fixing it. Maybe I'm just not cut out for chaos...
                        
                        <div class="optimistic-spin">
                            But you know what? Maybe the world needs more "villains" like me - ones who cause minor problems but then make sure everyone's okay! That's still chaos, right? Happy chaos!

                        This time it's because I "smiled too much during dinner" and Dad said it was "suspicious." I guess I was just really happy about the meatloaf! Mom makes the best meatloaf in the whole world!
                        
                        <div class="grounding-alert">
                            Being grounded means I get to spend more time in my room reading and organizing my Pokemon cards! I found my holographic Charizard and boy howdy, that sure brightened my day!
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            Dad peeked in earlier and asked why I wasn't "crying or complaining like a normal kid." I told him it's because I love spending time in my room and being with my family, even when I'm in trouble! He got that confused look again.
                        </div>
                        
                        Maybe tomorrow I'll get ungrounded and we can all have ice cream together! Or maybe I'll stay grounded and get to reorganize my sock drawer! Either way sounds pretty swell to me!
                        
                        <div class="optimistic-spin">
                            Being grounded teaches me patience and helps me appreciate the little things! Like how the light comes through my window just right at 3:47 PM, or how my pillow smells like lavender because Mom uses that special detergent!
                        </div>
                        
                        Life is just so darn wonderful, even when it's not! Oh hamburgers, I'm lucky! 🍔

                        Just got back from my therapy session and golly, what a great day! 🌈
                        
                        Dr. Bradshaw says I'm making "remarkable progress" in my "emotional resilience." I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds real positive!
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            She asked me how I feel about being grounded so much, and I told her it gives me time to think about all the good things in my life! She wrote that down real fast and said something about "adaptive coping mechanisms."
                        </div>
                        
                        We also talked about my Professor Chaos activities. She says it's "healthy" that I want to "express agency" but that my schemes are "remarkably benign." I think those are all good words!
                        
                        <div class="optimistic-spin">
                            She gave me a gold star sticker for "maintaining positivity in challenging circumstances." I'm gonna put it right next to the other 47 gold stars on my bedroom wall!
                        </div>
                        
                        Next week we're gonna talk about my "boundary-setting skills." Sounds educational! I love learning new things!

                        Practicing my tap dancing routine in the basement and boy howdy, I'm getting good! 👟✨
                        
                        I learned a new shuffle-ball-change combination that makes the most wonderful clickety-clack sound! It's like making music with your feet!
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            Dad came downstairs and watched for a whole minute before asking if I was "sure this is what boys do." I told him dancing is for everyone and that Gene Kelly was a real tough guy who could tap dance! He just shook his head and went back upstairs.
                        </div>

                            Some of the kids at school call it "weird," but I think they're just impressed by my fancy footwork! Kenny even gave me a thumbs up (I think - it was hard to tell through his parka).

                            UPDATE: I'm now grounded for "making too much noise" during practice. But that's okay! Silent tap dancing is even more challenging! It's like mime work but with better shoes!
                        </div>
                        
                        Maybe someday I'll be on Broadway! Or at least in the school talent show! Dreams are free!

                        Grandma Stotch came to visit and we had such a special time together! 🍪👵
                        
                        She's teaching me all sorts of interesting things about "becoming a grown-up" and "understanding my body." She says it's important education that my parents are "too prudish" to provide!
                        
                        <div class="innocent-moment">
                            We played some games that she said were "just between us," which makes me feel real special and trusted! She says I'm "developing beautifully" and that she's proud to be part of my "journey into manhood."

                            Mom and Dad seem a little upset about Grandma's visits, but I think they're just jealous of our special bond! It's nice having someone who understands me and wants to teach me about life!

                            I'm grounded now for "discussing inappropriate topics at the dinner table." I was just sharing what I learned! But Grandma says that sometimes grown-up education has to be our little secret.
                        </div>
                        
                        Can't wait for her next visit! She promised to bring more "educational materials" and maybe teach me about "personal exploration." Learning is so much fun!

                        My kissing business is really taking off! I've helped 12 people this week feel less lonely by providing professional kissing services for $5 per smooch!

                            Mrs. Henderson seemed real surprised when I knocked on her door offering my services. She said I was "sweet" but that she'd "call my parents." I think she was just impressed by my entrepreneurial spirit!

                        But don't worry, I'm pivoting to "Butters' Hug Company" instead! Hugs are free and everyone needs more hugs in their life! That's got to be legal, right?

                        Those were the best days of my life, learning about the real world from all those nice waitresses! Lexus taught me about makeup, Mercedes showed me how to walk in heels, and Porsche explained what "tips" really mean!

                            Sure, some people said the environment was "inappropriate for a child," but I learned so much about hospitality and customer service! Plus, I made $73 in tips, which is more money than I've ever had!

                        Maybe when I'm older I can open my own family-friendly restaurant! I'll call it "Butters' Burgers" and everyone will be welcome, no matter what age!
